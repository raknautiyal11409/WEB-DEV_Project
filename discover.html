				<h2>The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
				<p>So many superlatives have been used to describe the magnificent Cliffs of Moher that it's hard to find the right words. Vertigo-inducing and awe-inspiring spring to mind, and they are indeed both of these things, as well as being utterly wild and ruggedly beautiful. For those who've read up on the Emerald Isle prior to visiting, the cliffs will be familiar, starring as they do in countless postcards and guidebooks. Yet no image can ever do them justice. This is Ireland's most visited natural attraction and with good reason.</p>

				<h2>Grafton Street</h2>
				<p>So much more than just a great place to shop in Dublin, Grafton Street is alive with buskers, flower-sellers, and performance artists. You will also find countless places to stop off and simply watch the world meander by. Caf√© culture has taken off in the capital, and on a sunny day, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were in Barcelona or Lisbon. True, this is Dublin's shopping heartland, but there's no need to spend a fortune if visiting.</p>

				<h2>Killarney National Park</h2>
				<p>If visiting the Kerry region, the 19th-century Muckross House, Gardens, and Traditional Farms, set in spectacular Killarney National Park, should be top of your must-see list.Standing close to the shores of Muckross Lake, one of three Killarney lakes famed worldwide for their splendor and beauty, this former mansion oozes the grandeur and gentility of bygone days. There are Jaunting Cars to take you around the grounds in style. A highlight in the western part of Killarney National Park is the 11-kilometer drive over the scenic Gap of Dunloe, a narrow and rocky mountain pass carved by glaciers at the close of the Ice Age.</p>

				<h2>Trinity College</h2>
				<p>Ireland's oldest university, Trinity College in Dublin is one of the country's ancient treasures. Founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I, Trinity is a world within a world.Once you enter the gates and cross the cobblestones, it's as if the modern, thriving city outside simply melts away. A stroll in and around the grounds is a journey through the ages and into the hushed world of scholarly pursuit. Many shop and office workers take their lunchtime sandwiches here during summer months simply to escape the hustle and bustle outside.</p>

				<h2>Kilmainham Gaol</h2>
				<p>Featured in many a rebel song and occupying a notoriously dark place in Irish history, Kilmainham Gaol should be high on the list of Dublin's best places to visit for those with any interest in Ireland's troubled past. It was here that the leaders of the 1916 Uprising were brought and, after being convicted of High Treason, executed in the prison yard. The only one spared was future Irish President Eamon De Valera who, by virtue of his American citizenship, didn't suffer the same grisly fate.Dating from 1796, the prison was a dank vile institution that housed those guilty of such misdemeanours as being unable to pay their train fares and, during the famine, the destitute and hungry.</p>

				<h2>The Ring of Kerry</h2>
				<p>If in Kerry, take the time to explore what is arguably Ireland's most scenic route, the Ring of Kerry (Iveragh Peninsula). While you can start anywhere along this spectacular 111-mile-long tourist route, most people tend to set out from either Kenmare or Killarney ending, naturally enough, back in the same spot.The entire journey non-stop could take under three hours, but that's unlikely to happen. En-route there's a feast of jaw-dropping Atlantic Ocean views, stunning islands to visit, wild sweeping mountains, and many picturesque villages.</p>

				<h2>Glendalough</h2>
				<p>Magical and mysterious, Glendalough is home to one of the most important monastic sites in Ireland.

Visitors have flocked to the valley of the two lakes for thousands of years to absorb its rich history, magnificent scenery, plentiful wildlife, and fascinating archaeological finds.The monastic site with its incredibly preserved round tower is a joy to explore, and the surrounding woodlands and lakes are perfect for rambling through at your leisure or stopping off for a picnic. </p>

				<h2>Powerscourt</h2>
				<p>Superb views, serene lakeside walks, engaging history, and the stunning backdrop of Sugarloaf Mountain are just some of the treats in store when visiting this magnificent home, just 20 kilometers from Dublin.Now owned by the Slazenger family, the house is set on 47 manicured acres. Take time to stroll through the Rose and Kitchen Gardens and explore the beautiful Italian Gardens. There are more than 200 varieties of trees, shrubs, and flowers, and particularly moving is a section where much-loved family pets were buried complete with headstones and inscriptions.</p>

				<h2>Blarney Castle</h2>
				<p>Possibly Ireland's best-known attraction and one it's must-see-castles, the Blarney Stone sits high on a tower of Blarney castle, not far from Cork. Reputed to endow the famed Irish eloquence to those who dare hang their head over the parapets to kiss it, the stone is not the only reason for visiting Blarney Castle. Blarney Castle was built more than 600 years ago by Irish chieftain Cormac McCarthy, and you can tour the massive stone building from its towers to its dungeons. Extensive gardens surround it, filled with stone features and secret corners. Blarney Woollen Mills is known for its sweaters and other knitwear and has a shop selling crystal, porcelain, and other Irish gifts.</p>

				<h2>Kinsale</h2>
				<p>Soaked in history and in a scenic coastal setting at the gateway to West Cork, Kinsale has been attracting large numbers of visitors for decades. It's one of the best small towns in Ireland for tourists.The town has a decidedly Spanish feel, particularly in summer. This is hardly surprising bearing in mind that in 1601, three years after the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the Spanish sent a military force to Ireland, most of whom disembarked at Kinsale. This led to the English laying siege to the town and ultimately the defeat of Spanish and Irish forces by superior English military might.</p>

				<h2>The Dingle Peninsula</h2>
				<p>Part of The Wild Atlantic Way, a 1700-mile marked route around Ireland's west and adjacent coasts, the Dingle Peninsula combines wild beauty, history, and a glimpse of traditional Irish culture and language. It's not by accident: the region is designated as a Gaeltacht, where the Irish language and culture are protected by government subsidies. You'll hear Gaelic spoken and sung, and read it on signs, although everyone also speaks English. Ending at Dunmore Head, the Irish mainland's westernmost point, the peninsula is bordered by some of Ireland's best beaches and ragged cliffs.</p>

				<h2>St. Stephen's Green</h2>
				<p>
				Beloved by Dubliners and with a colorful history, tranquil St. Stephen's Green is a great place to wind down, enjoy a picnic, or feed the ducks. Incidentally, during the 1916 Uprising, special dispensation was given on both sides to the park keepers. Hostilities ceased daily so that the ducks could be properly fed. It could only happen in Dublin. Nowadays "The Green," as it's known locally, boasts beautifully maintained gardens, the ubiquitous Duck Pond, a picturesque bridge, recreation grounds, mature trees to rest beneath, and a playground.

				<h2>The Aran Islands</h2>
				<p>
				Originally brought to world attention in 1934 by the fictionalised documentary Man of Aran, these islands have been entrancing visitors ever since. This is a taste of Ireland as it once was. Gaelic is the first language, there are a mere 12,000 inhabitants, and once ashore, you'll feel as if you're in a time warp. There are three islands, the largest being Inishmore, then Inishmaan, and the smallest is Inisheer. Wild, windswept, rugged, and utterly unique, the islands offer a visitor experience quite like no other. Once experienced, the great stone fort of Dun Aonghasa and the towering cliffs of Aran will never be forgotten.
