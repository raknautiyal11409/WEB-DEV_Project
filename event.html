							<p>In early March 2019 Mullingar was named as the host town for Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann 2020. The event is the world’s largest annual celebration of Irish music, language, song and dance. It attracts in the region of 500,000 visitors to the host town every year. The event is organised by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and will be hosted in Mullingar in conjunction with the local Fleadh Executive Committee and Westmeath County Council.
							<br><br>
							Joe Connaire, chairperson of Westmeath Comhaltas and of the Fleadh Committee, thanked the members of the Ard Comhairle for putting their trust in Mullingar. We are bringing the Fleadh back to its roots, back to where it all began, and back to where our great organisation was founded. Finally, I would like to welcome everyone from all corners of the globe, to celebrate with us at Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann in Mullingar from August 2nd to 9th 2020.
